				vLua 5.1 - Lua written in Lua Virtual Machine
				---------------
				vLua is a virtual machine and compiler for dynamically compiling and executing Lua.
				It'll work on both client and server, regardless of LoadStringEnabled. This module is
				designed to be a drop in replacement for loadstring, meaning you can do the following:
				
				Example:
					local loadstring = require(workspace.Loadstring)
					local executable, compileFailReason = loadstring("print('hello from vLua!')")
					executable()
				
				Please note, vLua IS SLOWER COMPARED TO vanilla Lua, although Luau does improve performance.
				Do not attemptp to run performance intensive tasks without testing first, otherwise you
				may have a bad time.

				Changelog:
					[3222021]
						- fixed module erroring due to missing script variable
						- removed types until TypedLua is more stable/adopted
						- added an how to use example
				
					[372021]
						- updated  FiOne to latest release
						- migrated Yeuliang to improved version from Moonshine
